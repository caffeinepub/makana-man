# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Rebrand the site to “Makana Man” and refresh all customer-facing marketing/SEO copy to position the products as premium, healthy, high-protein snacks for all ages.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace all visible occurrences of “Makana Packet” with “Makana Man” across the frontend UI (header, logo alt text, footer, and page content on Home/About/Packets/Contact).
- Update marketing copy on Home/About/Packets/Contact to remove “gift packet” positioning and describe premium, healthy, high-protein snacks suitable for all ages (clear English).
- Update SEO/document titles on Home/About/Packets/Contact to use “Makana Man” and snack-focused descriptors.
- Rewrite the static “packets” product list names/descriptions to be snack-focused (premium, healthy, high-protein) while keeping existing routes and image asset references unchanged.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors see “Makana Man” branding throughout the site, read snack-focused premium/healthy/high-protein messaging on all main pages, and view an updated snack-oriented product list on the existing /packets page without broken images.
